# Emergency_route_optimization

 This system optimize in real-time situation in emergency multiple ambulance routes. In a dense city with its dense population and intricate transit network, exemplifies an urban landscape where efficient response is vital. The proposed system in this project aims to utilize the city's existing transit infrastructure effectively while introducing flexible measures to ensure rapid and safe evacuation. This is known as generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this problem, a demand node may
have capacity requirements that exceed the capacity of a single vehicle. This necessitates formulating a problem that allows for that demand node to be visited by more than one vehicle.
